My Vim Setup
====================

Installation
---------------------

- Clone the repo in your home directory with the name .vim
- link the file .vim/.vimrc to ~/.vimrc

Optional
--------
If using gvim
- link the file .vim/.gvimrc to ~/.gvimrc

Job done :-)

### Notes
You will require VIM > 7.2 and Ruby for some of the plugins to work.
